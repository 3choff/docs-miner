- Crawling is restricted to subdirectories of the initial URL to ensure focused documentation
- Output quality and content extraction depends on Jina AI's capabilities and limitations
- Rate limiting: 1 second delay between requests to prevent overloading
- May be affected by website's robots.txt and rate limiting policies
- Skips non-documentation links (PDFs, executables, etc.)
