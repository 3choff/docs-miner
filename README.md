# Docs Miner VSCode Extension

This extension allows you to generate markdown documentation from web pages using either the Jina AI Reader API or a browser-based method.

If you find Docs Miner useful, please consider leaving a star ‚≠ê on github repository or buying me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/3choff) to keep me motivated to work on this project.

## Features

- Generate markdown documentation from any web URL
- Two scraping methods:
  - API Method (Faster but may fail)
  - Browser Method (Slower but more reliable)
- Smart crawling that follows subdirectory structure from the initial URL
- Configurable crawling depth with precise level control
- Real-time progress tracking
- Stop crawling at any time
- Automatically saves the markdown file in your current workspace
- Opens the generated file for immediate viewing

## Usage

1. Open the Docs Miner sidebar (look for the Docs Miner icon in the Activity Bar)
2. Enter the URL you want to generate documentation from
3. Specify the output folder for the generated documentation
4. Adjust the crawling depth using the slider:
   - Depth 1: Current page only
   - Depth 2: Current page + one level down
   - Depth 3: Current page + two levels down
   - Depth 4: Current page + three levels down
   - Depth 5: Current page + four levels down
5. Click "Start Crawling" to begin
6. Monitor the progress in real-time
7. Use the "Stop Crawling" button if you want to end the process early

The markdown file will be automatically created in your specified output folder and opened for viewing.

## Requirements

- VSCode 1.80.0 or higher

## Technical Notes
- The extension offers two methods for content extraction:
  - Jina AI Reader API: Fast but may fail on some websites
  - Browser-based scraping: More reliable but slower, handles JavaScript-heavy sites
- Crawling is restricted to subdirectories of the initial URL to ensure focused documentation
- Rate limiting: 1 second delay between requests to prevent overloading
- May be affected by website's robots.txt and rate limiting policies
- Skips non-documentation links (PDFs, executables, etc.)
